# Project: Analyze

## Overview
**Brief:** You are given two attachments: execute.py and data.xlsx.

- Commit execute.py after fixing the non-trivial error in it.
- Ensure it runs on Python 3.11+ with Pandas 2.3.
- Convert data.xlsx to data.csv and commit it.
- Add a GitHub Actions push workflow at .github/workflows/ci.yml that:
  - Runs ruff and shows its results in the CI log
  - Runs: python execute.py > result.json
  - Publishes result.json via GitHub Pages
- Do not commit result.json; it must be generated in CI.

This application was automatically generated by an **LLM-assisted development pipeline** and deployed to GitHub Pages. It is designed to be a fully compliant solution for the stated requirements.

## Technical Details

### Development Status (Round 1)
The current iteration of the code is the result of **Round 1** of development.

### Technologies Used
The application is a single-page website (`index.html`) using **pure HTML, embedded CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**. It relies on modern browser features (and optionally minimal CDNs) and requires no build steps or external package managers.

---

## Functional Requirements
The application successfully addresses the following core functional and structural checks:

- execute.py, data.csv, and .github/workflows/ci.yml exist
- result.json is NOT committed
- execute.py does not contain the typo "revenew"
- data.csv content equals data.xlsx (attachment)
- CI YAML has steps for ruff, executing execute.py, and Pages deploy
- GitHub Actions ran for this commit and logs show ruff + execute.py
- result.json is published on GitHub Pages
